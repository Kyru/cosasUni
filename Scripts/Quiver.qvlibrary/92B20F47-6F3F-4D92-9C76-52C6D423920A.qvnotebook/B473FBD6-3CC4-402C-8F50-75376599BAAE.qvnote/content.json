The make design independent from:\n+ Different delays among modules\n+ Different delays among the various lines of a module\n\nA clock synchronizes the advance of data among stages. The clock defines:\n+ When new data can go into the pipelined unit\n+ The time available fot stages to cope with their goal\n\n**Clock period (ideal case)**: same delay in all modules\n\nt = D/K  (D is the original circuit delay) "
