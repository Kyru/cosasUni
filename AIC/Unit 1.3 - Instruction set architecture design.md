## 1. General aspects related to instruction sets
#### Instruction set design factors
+ Instruction sets act as interfaces between programs and datapath of processors
+ Instructions result from program compilation
    + Those instructions rarely used by compilers -> useless
+ Experience in program compilation shows that
    + Although programs can be very complex, most of them are very simple
+ Fast execution simple instructions possible using simple datapaths -> CPI,Tâ†“
