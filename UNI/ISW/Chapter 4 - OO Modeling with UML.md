#### 1 - Motivations

+ OO methods represent requirements in terms of objects and the services they offer
+ OO methods are more "naturaL" than traditional, structured ones

### 2 - Views of a Software System

#### Static View
*Object:*
+  Entity that exists in the real world
+  Have identity and are differentiated from each other 
  + Examples:
      +  The plane with number x
      +  A costumer

*Object Classes:*
+ Same Properties
+ Same Behaviour

***Associations***
Allows linking or connecting objects of different clases
Example: A country has one capital => Combines an object country with an object capital

***Generalization/Specialization***
Act or result obtained after distinguishing a concept that is more general than another
Example: Figure can contain the objects: square, triangle and circle

**Static Aspect:** Describes the static structure of a system and its interrelationships
> Intra objects => classes, attributes | Inter-objects => Association, Generalization

#### Dynamic View

Objects communicate by means of invocation of operations on other objects
The dynamic view describes the aspects of a system that change over time:
+ Interactions between objects
+ Possible states of an object
+ Transitions between states
+ What events are produced
+ What operations are executed

> MSCs: describe interactions between different points

#### Summary

Static View: Structure and interrelationships
Dynamic View: Aspects that change overtime

### 3 - OO Methods

OO Analysis:
+ A specification of the problem is created
+ Describes what the system must do

OO Design: 
+ Definition of a software solution to satisfy the requirements
+ Describes how the system will work

#### 4 - The UML Language
UML = Unified Modeling Language
It functions as a general purpose for OO modelling

**Success Triangle**
Notation => UML
Process (methodology) = RUP, USDP
Tool => Rational Rose, Objecteering, Visio (programa para hacer graficas vectoriales)

> UML is not a method, it is a notation to describe systems
