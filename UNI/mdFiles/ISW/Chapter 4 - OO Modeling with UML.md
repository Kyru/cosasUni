### View of a Software System
#### Static View
+ Entity that exists in the real world
+ Have identity and are differentiated from each other

#### Dynamic View
+ Objects communicate by means of invocation of operations on other objects
+ Describes the aspects of a system that change over time:
    + Interaction between objects
    + Possible states of an object
    + Transitions between states
    + What events are produced
    + What operations are executed

### OO Methods
+ OO Analysis:
    + A specification of the problem is created
    + Describes what the system must do
+ OO Design:
    + Definition of a software solution to satisfy the requirements
    + Describes how the system will work

---

### The UML Language
> UML = Unified Modeling Language

+ A general purpose language for OO modelling
+ Starting Point:
    + Many OO methods with different notations
    + Learning and tool construction inconvenients
    + A uniform notation needed

> UML is not a method, it is a notation to describe systems

#### Use Case Model
Use cases is a technique to capture info about how a system or business presently works and how it is required to work in the future. They are used during requirements gathering to capture functional requirements of a system to be developed

+ Actors: Entities that exchange info with the system
+ Types:
    + Humans
    + Devices
    + Other software systems
+ A use case contains a sequence of transactions that exchange the actors and the system whenever a given functionality must be executed

#### Activity diagrams
+ Special case of a States diagram where:
    + All (or most) states are action-ones
    + All (or most) transitions are triggered by the finalization of actions
+ The diagram may be associated to a:
    + Class
    + Implementation of an operation
    + A use case
