### Peter Principle 
+ In a Hierarchy every employee tends to Rise to his level of incompetence.
+ Basically, it states that generally speaking incompetent workers will be promoted above competent workers to managerial positions where they don't have to do any real work and the damage they do can be limited. 

### Competence
+ The ability to do something successfully or efficiently
+ The legal authority of a court or other body to deal with a particular matter 
+ Competence = Knowledge + experience + ability 
+ The concept of competence is also often referred as: 
    + **Motivation:** 
        + A reason(s) for acting or behaving in a particular way
        + Desire or willingness to do something (enthusiam)
    + **Attitude:** 
        + A settled way of thinking or feeling about something
    + **Potential:** 
        + Latent qualities or abilities that may be developed and lead to future success or usefulness
        + The possibility of something happening or of someone doing something in the future

Nowadays it has become fashionable to classify competences into: 
+ **Hard Skills**: referring to the technical work developed
+ **Soft Skills**: related to emotional intelligence, collaboration, teamwork, leadership...
+ The technical ones are high perishable, but not soft skills.
