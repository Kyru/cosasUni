#### Information System
An ***information system (IS)*** is a collection of elements, which are orderly realted to each other following some rules, that provide the entity they serve with the necessary information for the completion of its goals

Basic functions: 
+ Data gathering
+ Data processing
+ Data storage
+ Data elaboration and presentation

#### Database and DBMS

**Database:** Is a collection of structured data
**Database management system (DBMS):** Software tool that enables users to create, manipulate and maintain a database

The way in which reality is represented in the context of databases is known as a ***data model***.
Many different data models have been proposed: hierarchical, network, *relational*, object-oriented...
A DBMS assumes one data model and builds everything upon it

> A relational DBMS (RDBMS) is a DBMS based on the relational model

#### Database characteristics
+ *Integrating* all the organization's info
+ Data *Persistence*
+ *Shared Accesibility* to several users
+ *Unified* data description, independent of the applications
+ *Independence* between the *applications* and the physical representation
+ Description of *partial views* of the data for different users
+ Mechanisms to ensure data *Integrity* and *Security*

DB's Goal:
Global integration of the system's information in order to *avoid_redundancies*, with no loss of the different datbase *perspectives* by users.

> DBMSs must ensure data independence, integrity and security
