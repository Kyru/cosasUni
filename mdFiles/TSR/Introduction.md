What is a distributed system?
- We need at least 2 computers => Computer Network
- Which means many "independent" processes are collaborating in order to achieve a common goal

Providing to the user the image of a ***Single System*** => Distribution transparency **OUR GOAL!** 

Types of Transparency: 
* Access
* Location 
* Replication
* Failure

They provide Efficiency and Continuos Availablity.
[When incrementing the data we should incrementing in every computer to maintain consistency]

Request/Reply must be synchrounous => following a set of steps
Asynchronous programming tries to break this steps thanks to the use of clien/servers structures.
> JavaScript - Permits asynchronous interactions among processess

## What is it going to appear in each (some) Units
+ Unit 2: Distributed Systmes Software
    + Provides a system model being needed for theoretical discussims in the subsequent unis
+ Unit 4: Deployment
    + Docker => Container management   

In the labs we'll use JavaScript -> Interpreted language **without compiler**
#### Three Projects:
+ TCP/IP Reverse Proxy
+ NodeJS and Ã˜MQ app development
+ Deployment
